/*Two pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are said to be symmetric if c is equal to b and a is equal to d.
 *  For example (10, 20) and (20, 10) are symmetric. Given an array of pairs find all symmetric pairs in it.
 * It may be assumed that first elements of all pairs are distinct.
 * Input: arr[] = {{11, 20}, {30, 40}, {5, 10}, {40, 30}, {10, 5}}
	Output: Following pairs have symmetric pairs
        (30, 40) and(5, 10)
