/*  Bottom Up::
 *  The tabulated program for a given problem builds a table in bottom up fashion and returns the last entry from table. 
 *  For example, for the same Fibonacci number, we first calculate fib(0) then fib(1) then fib(2) then fib(3) and so on.
 *   So literally, we are building the solutions of subproblems bottom-up.
